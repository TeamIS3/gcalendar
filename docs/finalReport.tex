\section{Overview}

Basic stuff about what we did...

\section{Specification}
The swing prototype does not meet every detail in the specification.
        The following list displays the current functionality with shortcomings,
        when compared to the specification, that is currently included in the
        prototype:
        \begin{itemize}
       
        \item It is possible for the user to add and delete appointments. This is
        done by manipulating a text file; writes to the text file when creating an
         event and reading from the file when needed to retrieve events for deletion.
        \item Edit an appointment is not currently possible, although the user can
        always delete an event and re-create it to get around this problem.
        \item The route the user would take to set a recurring appointment is
        visually displayed however the functionality of mapping that appointment
        is not included.
        \item It's possible to switch between day, week ,month and year view
        via buttons that are perpetually located at the top of the calendar. Current
        system status is shown by which button is currently depressed.
        \item In order for the user to determine the busiest/quietest days, in year
        view each day has a cell and is coloured depending on busyness. There is a
        gradual change from red, on the busy side of scale, to blue, on the non busy
        side of the scale.
        \item  During the event creation process, it is possible for the user to
        select the category associated with the event, whether it be home, work or
        other. However, as with the recurring appointment, the mapping of category
        and events is not implemented.
        \item As the events are not mapped to a category it is not currently
        possible to display events of a given category.

        \end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation of design}

To evaluate the design of the Swing prototype that the group produced, two main techniques
were used.  

The first method the group decided to use for evaluating the design of the prototype was a
heuristic evaluation. 
the group felt that a heuristic evaluation is a fast and cheap way to preform a usability
inspection on the prototype, and would be a easy way to identify usability problems with the
design of the system. 

one member of the team (James) was selected as an evaluator, and tasked with examing the
interface of the prototype calendar and evaluating how it complies with recognized usability
principles. 

The first thing the evaluator did was to select a collection of use cases, which he could
then use to evaluate the extent to which the interface is likely to be compatible with the
intended usersâ€™ needs. 

The use cases selected were : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Add an appointment.
\item Change views from month, to week, to day.
\item Add an appointment.
\item Set a recurring appointment to occur once a week and finish in three months time.
\item Find the busiest and quietest days in the month.
\item Set different categories for university, social and job appointments.
\end{itemize}

After this the evaluator decided on a set of heuristics on which the prototype should be
judged. 

\subsection{Heuristic Evaluation}

The evaluator decided upon a set of heuristics on which the Swing prototype the team built
should be judged.

The heuristics selected were as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Visibility of system status: The system should always keep users informed about what is
going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 

\item Match between system and the real world: The system should speak the users' language,
with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.
Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
 
\item User control and freedom: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need
a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an
extended dialogue. Support undo and redo. 

\item Consistency and standards: Users should not have to wonder whether different words,
situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. 

\item Error prevention: Even better than good error messages is a careful design which
prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions
or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the
action. 

\item Recognition rather than recall: Minimize the user's memory load by making objects,
actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part
of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily
retrievable whenever appropriate. 

\item Flexibility and efficiency of use: Accelerators, unseen by the novice user, may often
speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both
inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 
    
\item Aesthetic and minimalist design: Dialogues should not contain information which is
irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the
relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 
    
\item Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: Error messages should be
expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively
suggest a solution. 
    
\item Help and documentation: Even though it is better if the system can be used without
documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information
should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out,
and not be too large.    
\end{itemize}

Below are the findings from the evaluation:

\section{Comparison with paper prototype}

When implementing the Swing Prototype we first attempted to implement
the more essential features of our paper prototype then moving on to
implementing less important features.

We began by implementing the Month view we had in our paper prototype.
We decided to keep the majority of features the same as they appeared
in the paper prototype, the only exception being the summary side bar.
Initially we omitted the side bar, intending to implement it once more
important features had been implemented. However, in the interest of
simplifying the implementation process, we ultimately decided to
implement this feature as a separate 'Day' view. The Week and Year
views were then created the same as they appeared in the paper
prototype, with the addition of an another button at the top of the
screen to allow the new Day view to be selected.

Then we created the dialogue boxes for the pop up windows which appeared in our
paper prototype when the user was adding new events, adding event
reminders and adding repetitions to events. These were implemented with
the same features as they had in the paper prototype. We also
implemented the pop up window for setting event categories the same as
it appeared in the paper prototype but without the button for adding new
categories.
