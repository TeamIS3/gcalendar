\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Identification}

\begin{itemize}{}{}
\item Give an overview of your paper prototypes, the early designs and
how you came to your final prototype design;

\item Explain how they work;

\item Report on your heuristic evaluation/think aloud, any problems you
found and how you resolved them (include the key paper prototypes that
you built);

\item Make a simple video of your final prototype (video from a phone
is fine) upload it to a video sharing site so we can see it in action.
I am not expecting Hollywood quality, but just enough to get an idea
of how your system would work. You can get some inspiration from the
video above;

\item Once your video is publicly available, send the link out to
friends and family and get them to comment in the public area and use
that information to create suggestions for improving the design.



\end{itemize}
