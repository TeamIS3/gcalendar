\section{Preamble}

\subsection{In This Report}

\begin{itemize}
\item Give an overview of your paper prototypes, the early designs and
how you came to your final prototype design;

\item Explain how they work;

\item Report on your heuristic evaluation/think aloud, any problems you
found and how you resolved them (include the key paper prototypes that
you built);

\item Make a simple video of your final prototype (video from a phone
is fine) upload it to a video sharing site so we can see it in action.
I am not expecting Hollywood quality, but just enough to get an idea
of how your system would work. You can get some inspiration from the
video above;

\item Once your video is publicly available, send the link out to
friends and family and get them to comment in the public area and use
that information to create suggestions for improving the design.
\end{itemize}

\section{Overview}

Insert references in this text for the different calendars if they
have websites.

Our prototypes were based on the Facebook, OS X, Evolution on Scientific
Linux and Google Calendars. For prototyping and evaluating we split up
into two person teams. For the purposes of the discussion the teams are
labelled based on the calendars they evaluated.

The final paper prototype was a combination of our findings from the
calendars above and the design is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:fpp}.

\section{Calendar on OS X}

Paper prototype has minimalist design with four views: day, week, month
and year. These views are available through four buttons that are
always on the screen at the top center-right of the screen. The
currently selected view is colour/depressed differently than the
others.

\subsection{Problems during Evaluation}

Participant noted feeling uncomfortable during the evaluation as it was
unnatural for the them to have to vocalise their actions. At some points
during the experiment, the participant seemed confused or suprised by
the feedback from the system, occasionally expressing uncertainty on how
to proceed further with the task.
